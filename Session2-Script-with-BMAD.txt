SESSION 2: THE ART OF PLANNING
How I Stopped Fighting AI and Started Shipping
================================================================================

A 60-Minute Journey from "I Can't" to "I'm Building"
Complete Presentation Script & Stage Directions
Presenter: Longy

REVISED VERSION — Includes BMAD Method Video & Demo


================================================================================
THE NARRATIVE ARC
================================================================================

"There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in 
to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists."
                                        — Andrej Karpathy, Co-founder of OpenAI
                                          February 2025

This session is your hero's journey. You walk in thinking "I'm not technical 
enough." You walk out knowing the secret: the people shipping with AI aren't 
better coders—they're better planners.

THE FOUR ACTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ACT 1 — I Was You (0:00–13:00)
   The confession, the crash, the 20-hour nightmare

2. ACT 2 — What AI Actually Needs (13:00–28:00)
   The revelation, the framework, the mindset shift

3. ACT 2.5 — BMAD Method: Planning in Action (28:00–40:00) *** NEW ***
   Video introduction + Demo recap

4. ACT 3 — You Becoming Builders (40:00–60:00)
   The proof, the practice, the transformation


================================================================================
ACT 1: I WAS YOU
================================================================================

0:00–5:00 | THE HOOK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Single slide. Black background. White text, slowly fading in:
"Six months ago, I was terrified of this."

YOU SAY:

"Hi everyone. I'm Longy.

I want to start with a confession. Not a humble-brag confession. A real one.

Six months ago, if you'd asked me to build something with AI, I would have 
smiled politely and thought: 'That's for the technical people. I'll wait 
for IT.'

I wasn't just nervous. I was convinced there was something fundamentally 
different about people who could make software—some gene I didn't have.

[Pause. Let that land.]

Then I discovered something that changed everything. Not a secret tool. 
Not a hack. A mindset shift.

And today, I'm going to give you that same shift in the next 55 minutes.

By the end of this session, you won't be a programmer. But you'll understand 
why that doesn't matter anymore."


ENGAGEMENT MOMENT:
[Show a quick poll on screen or ask for hands:]

"Quick temperature check. One word in the chat—or just shout it out—how do 
you feel about building something with AI right now?

Excited? Curious? Skeptical? Terrified? All valid."

[React to 2-3 responses. Normalise the nerves. 'Terrified is exactly where 
I was.']


BRIDGE FROM SESSION 1:

"In Session 1, you learned what AI can do—and more importantly, what it can't. 
You learned about context windows, about how AI has no memory between sessions, 
about the 'brilliant intern who read the internet but knows nothing about your 
company.'

Session 2 is the missing piece: how do you actually work with that brilliant, 
forgetful intern without losing your mind?

The answer isn't 'become a developer.' The answer is 'become a planner.'"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5:00–13:00 | THE DISASTER STORY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Visual timeline appears—horizontal, clean, 5 stages:
Excitement → Frustration → Bug-fix Hell → Breakthrough → Clarity
First stage (Excitement) is highlighted. The others are greyed out.

YOU SAY:

"Let me tell you about the project that broke me. And then rebuilt me.

The Banking Communication System.

The idea was beautiful: take those boring standardised bank letters—you know 
the ones, dense paragraphs nobody reads—and transform them into personalised 
digital voice notes. Customers could actually hear their updates instead of 
decoding legal jargon.

I was buzzing. I had AI tools. I had ambition. How hard could it be?"


STAGE 1: EXCITEMENT
[Timeline: 'Excitement' stage glows]

"Day one. I open Claude's web interface. I describe the whole system in one 
massive prompt. 'Build me this. Make it do that. Include safety checks. 
Handle edge cases.'

And the AI starts generating code. Beautiful, flowing code. I copy it into 
my editor. It works!

Well... parts of it work. But I'm excited. This is amazing. I'm going to 
ship this in a weekend."


STAGE 2: FRUSTRATION
[Timeline: Move to 'Frustration']

"Day two. The file is now 500 lines. Then 700. Then 1,000.

I'm copying code from the web chat, pasting it into VS Code. Back and forth. 
Copy. Paste. Copy. Paste. Like it's 1998.

I fix one bug... and three more appear. The AI starts contradicting itself. 
'Earlier you said X, now you're saying Y.'

I'm spending more time debugging than building."


STAGE 3: BUG-FIX HELL
[Timeline: 'Bug-fix Hell' pulses red]

"Then I remember: this thing needs a safety check. AI can hallucinate. It 
might generate voice notes that say completely wrong things.

So I ask the AI to add a 'hallucination detector' at the end.

But the codebase is already 1,000 lines of tangled spaghetti. Adding safety 
means ripping apart everything I've built.

Every change breaks something else. I'm 20 hours in. I've shipped nothing. 
And I'm starting to think: 'Maybe I'm just not technical enough for this.'"

[Pause. Look at audience.]

"Anyone here ever had that thought? 'Maybe this just isn't for me'?"

[Wait for nods, reactions. Acknowledge them.]


THE DIAGNOSIS:

"Here's what I eventually realised:

I didn't have an AI problem. I had a PLANNING problem.

The AI wasn't broken. I was asking it to hold 1,000 lines of context in its 
head. But remember what Session 1 taught you? AI has a limited 'working 
memory'—the context window.

I'd filled that window to bursting. The AI was literally forgetting what 
we'd agreed 400 lines ago. And I was surprised when it contradicted itself."


THE WHITEBOARD METAPHOR:

"Think of the AI's context window like a whiteboard. Everything you've 
discussed in a session—your prompts, its responses, the code it's generated—
gets written on that whiteboard.

But the whiteboard has edges. When it fills up, the oldest stuff gets erased 
to make room for new stuff. The AI isn't being dumb. It literally cannot see 
what fell off the whiteboard."


================================================================================
ACT 2: WHAT AI ACTUALLY NEEDS
================================================================================

13:00–18:00 | THE REVELATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Famous quote appears:
"Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."
— Dwight D. Eisenhower

YOU SAY:

"Eisenhower led the D-Day invasion—the largest amphibious assault in history. 
And he said this: 'Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.'

The plan will change. That's fine. But the act of planning forces you to 
break work into pieces. To decide what matters first. To define what 'done' 
looks like.

AI loves that. AI is terrible at filling in vagueness."


THE MINDSET SHIFT:

"Here's the mindset shift that turned everything around for me:

AI is your developer. You are the architect.

Architects don't lay bricks. They don't wire electricity. They design the 
structure. They define what each room does. They specify how the pieces 
connect.

That's you now. You're not writing code—you're writing specifications that 
AI can execute."

"The hottest new programming language is English."
                                        — Andrej Karpathy, 2023


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18:00–28:00 | THE FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE 5 THINGS AI NEEDS YOU TO PLAN
[Reveal these one by one as you discuss each. Build anticipation.]


1. A CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENT

"If you start with 'Build me a cool AI tool,' the AI guesses. And it 
guesses wrong.

But if you start with: 'Customer service spends 3 hours a day answering 
repeat emails about account balances. Build something that answers those 
automatically.'

Now the AI understands the job to be done. The constraint. The success 
condition."


2. SMALL PIECES (MODULES)

"Remember the whiteboard? You can't dump 'the whole system' on it.

You plan small pieces: 'Email reader.' 'Topic detector.' 'Response 
generator.' 'Quality checker.'

Each piece fits on the whiteboard. The AI can handle it brilliantly. 
Then you connect them."


3. INPUTS & OUTPUTS (CONTRACTS)

"Every piece gets a little contract. 'Takes X, produces Y.'

This is how you stop prompts like 'Can you just make it better?' that 
lead to chaos.

Instead: 'The Topic Detector takes raw email text as input. It outputs 
one of five categories: Balance Inquiry, Transaction Dispute, Account 
Access, Card Issues, or Other.'

Clear. Testable. The AI can't misunderstand."


4. BUILD ORDER

"What comes first? What depends on what?

Build your safety check BEFORE the fancy features. Learn from my mistake."


5. VERIFICATION STEPS

"How will you know it worked? Not 'it looks good' but 'here's the test 
case that proves it.'"


================================================================================
ACT 2.5: BMAD METHOD — PLANNING IN ACTION
================================================================================

*** NEW SECTION — 12 MINUTES ***
*** INCLUDES VIDEO (~5 mins) + DISCUSSION (~7 mins) ***


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28:00–30:00 | INTRODUCING BMAD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Slide: "From Theory to Reality: Meet Your AI Development Team"

YOU SAY:

"So far, I've given you the theory: plan before you build, break things 
into modules, define inputs and outputs.

But theory is useless without practice. And I promised you'd see real 
planning in action.

What if I told you there's a system that takes everything we just discussed—
the architect mindset, the modular thinking, the clear specifications—and 
wraps it into a structured workflow with specialised AI agents that guide 
you through each step?

This is the BMAD Method."


ON SCREEN:
Display: "BMAD = Breakthrough Methodology for Agile AI-Driven Development"

YOU SAY:

"BMAD stands for Breakthrough Methodology for Agile AI-Driven Development. 
But what it really means is this: instead of talking to one AI that tries 
to do everything, you work with a team of specialised AI agents—each with 
a specific role.

Just like a real development team:

• An ANALYST who helps you brainstorm and clarify your idea
• A PRODUCT MANAGER (PM) who writes the requirements document
• An ARCHITECT who designs the technical structure
• A SCRUM MASTER who breaks work into stories
• A DEVELOPER who writes the code

Remember Session 1 when we talked about AI agents? This is agents in action—
each one specialised, each one focused."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30:00–35:00 | THE BMAD VIDEO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Play pre-recorded video (approximately 5 minutes)

BEFORE VIDEO:

"I've put together a short video that explains how BMAD works—the phases, 
the agents, and why this approach is so powerful.

Pay attention to the four phases. You'll see our five planning principles 
embedded throughout."


VIDEO CONTENT (What the video covers):
1. Phase 1 — Analysis: Brainstorming and research (optional but recommended)
2. Phase 2 — Planning: Creating the PRD (Product Requirements Document)
3. Phase 3 — Solutioning: Designing architecture and UX
4. Phase 4 — Implementation: Story-driven development with continuous validation

The video also covers:
- Scale-adaptive tracks (Quick Flow vs Full BMAD)
- Agent handoffs
- How context is preserved between agents through documentation


[PLAY VIDEO — 5 MINUTES]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35:00–40:00 | POST-VIDEO DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AFTER VIDEO:

"Notice something? Every phase produces a document. The Analyst creates a 
project brief. The PM creates a PRD. The Architect creates technical specs.

Why? Because AI forgets. But documents don't.

When the Developer agent starts coding, it loads those documents as context. 
It knows exactly what to build because the planning happened first—
systematically, through specialised agents.

This is the architect mindset operationalised."


THE DEMO FLOW (What you saw / will see):

"Let me walk you through what a typical BMAD session looks like:

Step 1: INITIALISE
Run *workflow-init and tell BMAD what you want to build.
It recommends a track based on complexity.

Step 2: PM AGENT
The PM asks you guided questions:
- What's the input format?
- What's the output?
- What edge cases matter?
- How will we verify success?

These are our five planning principles—but the agent asks the questions.

Step 3: TECH SPEC GENERATED
In a few minutes of conversation, you get a complete spec:
- Clear problem statement
- Defined modules
- Input/output contracts
- Build order
- Acceptance criteria

Step 4: DEVELOPER AGENT
The Dev agent reads the spec. It doesn't ask what to build—it already knows.
The spec is the context. The developer follows the plan.

Step 5: SHIP IT
Working code, built from a clear plan."


KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM BMAD:

"Before we move on, let's crystallise why this matters:

• SPECIALISATION BEATS GENERALISM
  One AI trying to do everything forgets what it agreed. Five specialised 
  agents, each doing their job, stay focused.

• DOCUMENTS ARE MEMORY
  AI forgets between sessions. Documents persist. Each phase creates a 
  document that the next phase reads.

• STRUCTURE ENABLES SPEED
  It feels slower to plan first. But you saw it—minutes to a complete spec. 
  Compare that to my 20-hour disaster.

• YOU DON'T NEED TO REMEMBER BEST PRACTICES
  The agents ask the right questions. You just answer them."


"You don't have to use BMAD for the hackathon. But the principles are the 
same whether you use BMAD, or a one-page template, or just a notepad:

PLAN BEFORE YOU BUILD. BREAK IT INTO PIECES. DEFINE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS.

BMAD just makes that systematic."


================================================================================
ACT 3: YOU BECOMING BUILDERS
================================================================================

40:00–52:00 | LIVE PLANNING EXERCISE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Display the 1-Page AI Project Plan template — blank

YOU SAY:

"You've seen me plan. You've seen BMAD plan. Now it's your turn.

We're going to fill out a one-page plan together—live. Same principles, 
simpler format.

The problem we'll plan: An AI Email Assistant for customer service."


SECTION 1: THE PROBLEM (2 min)
[Fill in together:]

"What job is this doing? Shout it out."

[Wait for responses. Type:]
• Help customer service agents respond faster to common email queries
• Reduce time spent on repetitive responses
• Maintain quality and personalisation


SECTION 2: SUCCESS METRICS (2 min)

"How will we know it worked? Speed? Quality? Fewer escalations?"

[Wait for responses. Type 2-3 into template:]
• Suggested responses generated in <5 seconds
• 80%+ of suggestions require minimal editing before sending
• Reduces average reply time by 50%


SECTION 3: THE PIECES (3 min)

"What are the jobs this thing needs to do?
Shout them out: 'Read email.' 'Understand topic.' 'Write draft.' 
'Check quality.' 'Hand to human.'"

[Cluster their answers into 4 modules:]
1. Email Reader: Extracts customer question from raw email
2. Topic Detector: Categorises into Balance/Dispute/Access/Card/Other
3. Response Generator: Creates draft reply based on category + templates
4. Quality Checker: Flags anything that looks wrong before human review

"Notice again: You're doing the planning. AI will do the typing."


SECTION 4: INPUTS & OUTPUTS (2 min)
[Fill a quick table live:]

"This is where 'vibes' become 'engineering.'
When you tell AI 'this thing takes X and produces Y', its chances of doing 
something useful skyrocket."


SECTION 5: BUILD ORDER (1 min)

"What do we build first?

The Quality Checker comes early—not last. We want safety in place before 
the fancy stuff. Lesson learned from my disaster."

"You've just done the exact thinking you'll need for your hackathon project. 
Same template, different problem."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52:00–55:00 | TOOL OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SCREEN:
Display tool comparison table

YOU SAY:

"You've got a plan. Now you need tools. Here's the landscape:

• REPLIT: Zero setup. Code runs in the browser. Perfect if you want to 
  ship fast without worrying about environments.

• CURSOR: VS Code with AI built in. Great if you already have code you 
  want to extend.

• CLAUDE CODE: Command-line power. Best for complex projects where you 
  want full control.

• BMAD METHOD: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, or VS Code. Adds the 
  structured workflow we just saw."


"My recommendation for the hackathon:

• If you want speed and simplicity: Replit
• If you want structure and guidance: BMAD + Claude Code  
• If you're extending existing code: Cursor

Session 3 will help you pick based on your specific project."


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55:00–60:00 | THE TRANSFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CALL TO ACTION: YOU'RE NEXT

ON SCREEN:
"From 'I Can't' → 'I'm Building'"
Three bullets beneath:
• Fill the template before coding
• Choose tools that fit the plan
• Bring your plan to Session 3

YOU SAY:

"Let's land this.

The core message of today isn't 'Longy did a cool project' or 'BMAD is 
impressive.'

It's this: Planning isn't overhead. With AI, planning is the shortcut."


"We've covered:

• How my Banking Communication System went sideways when I skipped planning
• Why AI's context window punishes giant, vague tasks
• The five things AI needs you to plan: problem, pieces, contracts, build 
  order, verification
• How BMAD operationalises these principles with specialised agents
• How a one-page plan—or a structured system—turns AI from chaos into a 
  reliable partner
• And you've practiced that on a real example"


THE RETURN TO THE HERO'S JOURNEY:

"At the start, I said I was like you six months ago.

'Not technical enough.' 'I'll let IT handle that.'

The only thing that changed was this: I learned to plan for AI like an 
architect, not like a desperate person shouting at a magic box.

That is literally the gap between me burning 20 hours... and me using AI 
to build this entire training program."


MICRO-COMMITMENT:

"If you're willing to fill out a one-page template—or try BMAD's workflow-init—
before you touch code in the hackathon, hit 👍 now."

[Pause. React to the flood of thumbs.]

"Amazing.
Session 3 is where we pick your real problems and tune these plans. After 
that: build time."


Q&A (3-4 min)
[Take 2-3 questions. Prepared answers for common ones:]

• "How much planning is enough?"
  → If you can explain each piece in one sentence, you're ready.

• "What if I don't have a problem yet?"
  → Session 3 has a problem selection workshop. Come ready to brainstorm.

• "Which tool should I use?"
  → Session 3 covers this. Short answer: Replit for speed, Claude Code + 
    BMAD for structure, Cursor for existing code.

• "Do I need to use BMAD?"
  → No. The one-page template achieves the same goal. BMAD just automates 
    the discipline.


FINAL CLOSE:

"You do not need to become a hardcore developer.

You need to become ruthless about planning clearly.

Let AI be the one typing late into the night. Your job is to tell it what 
to build and how you'll know it worked.

That's how you go from 'I can't'... to 'I'm building.'

See you in Session 3."
